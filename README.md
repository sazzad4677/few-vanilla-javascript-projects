## -> This is a simple javascript dom manipulation project in which you must guess the hidden number from 1 to 20.

1. You will lose one point for each incorrect guess.
2. You lose the game if your score is equal to zero.
3. If the guessing number is greater than the hidden number, the message "Too high" will be displayed; otherwise, "Too low."
4. You win if you get the correct number, and your higherscore will be updated.
